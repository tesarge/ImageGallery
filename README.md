# ImageGallery
An image gallery using vanilla JavaScript.

This was my first working project using JavaScript. As a mostly self-taught developer, this project proved to be a major confidence booster. In this project I learned:

...How to use JS to change HTML styling

...How to use the client console to test and trouble shoot JS

...How to use VS Code Live Server
